I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at at UCL and Imperial College London. With a background in molecular pharmacology, I am interested in how causal perturbations, like drugs, can be used to generate a multiscale understanding of the human brain. Broadly, my work aims to reveal the structure and dynamics of distributed computation in the brain, and how emergent macroscopic processes support conscious states. In doing so, I try to advance theory-driven markers of consciousness, as well as data-driven approaches that guide new theory.
